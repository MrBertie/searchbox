====== Searchindex Manager ======

This page allows you to rebuild the index used by the fulltext search.
This isn't needed generally as  the index builds and updates itself while
users browse your wiki. However if you just upgraded, added or removed
a lot of files it may be a good idea to cleanup the the index.

This manager needs a recent browser as it makes use of modern JavaScript
to carry out multiple tasks in the background (using [[wp>AJAX]]).

Rebuilding the index takes a long time. You should leave the page open
until the indexing has finished.
